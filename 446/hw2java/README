Update:

problem_[1~5].sh: run code for problem 1~5
problems:
1: SGD
2. DT
3. DT4
4. DT8
5. D stump with SGD

stumpCreator.sh and FeatureCreator.sh run related code to generate features or stumps.

SGD.py: main program of Stochastic Gradient Decreasing algorithm
WekaTester.java: changed to output any decisiontrees
FeatureGenerator.java: Generated 536+1 features 



Here is a brief description of the contents of this directory

- README: This file

- src: This contains the java sources. It contains three files:
   1. Id3.java: A modified version of Weka's Id3 code, which can be trained upto a limited depth.

   2. FeatureGenerator.java: An example feature generator that generates features in the ARFF format.

   3. WekaTester.java: An example that shows how the decision tree learner can be used

- lib: This contains the weka.jar corresponding to Weka v3.6.3
  
- test.sh: A shell script that runs the feature generator and the decision tree trainer

- Makefile: A makefile to compile the java code
